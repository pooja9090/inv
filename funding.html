 Funding

<p>
Target-date funds typically have a greater percentage of stocks relative to bonds the farther away the target date is. A "to" fund takes less risk than a "through" fund, and it may achieve lower returns as a result. The other big risk of using a to fund is that, if you hold it past the target date, its lack of investment risk means your nest egg will not continue to grow and you could outlive your retirement savings.

Before investing in any target-date fund, investors should examine its glide path (how it progressively becomes more conservative) to determine how the fund's asset allocation changes over time and whether it is a "to" fund or a "through" fund.
